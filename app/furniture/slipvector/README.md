## Design
- Encourage multi-generational play
- Develop habits for imagining and building a better future through making decisions well together.
- Nurture creative and artistic skills.

### Game Design
- Largely co-operative (or non-domination oriented at least),
- Multi-player first; with strong Single-player support.
- Prioritizes developmentally appropriate mechanics based upon each game's youngest intended age.
- Provides affordances to support players across the spectrum of sensory and manipulative ability


### Narrative Design
- Affirming and hopeful, but not devoid of consequence.
- Meaningful emotional growth occurs across the age spectrum
- Incorporates both chosen family and born family relationships
- More focused on the healing than the hurting

### Visual Art Design
- *Should* perform well on 4+ year old devices
- Hand-drawn
- Lo-fidelity
- Cartoonish
- Solarpunk Future

### Music and Sound Design
